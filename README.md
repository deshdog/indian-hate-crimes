The .ipynb file contains the final demo and project elements for grading. Please note that this file is formatted for Jupyter Notebook, but can not be run/executed on Github. It must be downloaded, along with MySQL, Python, and all of the necessary API's and run locally.

I have also included the code in a .py file.
